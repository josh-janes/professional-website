# Getting Started with Nuxt 3

Nuxt 3 represents a significant leap forward in the Vue.js ecosystem, bringing improved performance, better developer experience, and native TypeScript support. In this guide, we'll explore what makes Nuxt 3 special and how to get started.

## Why Nuxt 3?

Nuxt 3 is built on top of Vue 3 and leverages the latest web technologies to provide:

- **Blazing Fast Performance**: Powered by Vite and Nitro engine
- **TypeScript Support**: First-class TypeScript integration out of the box
- **Auto-imports**: Components, composables, and utilities are automatically imported
- **Server-Side Rendering**: Built-in SSR with edge-side rendering capabilities
- **File-based Routing**: Convention over configuration for routing

## Installation

Getting started with Nuxt 3 is straightforward:

```bash
npx nuxi@latest init my-app
cd my-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

This creates a new Nuxt 3 project with all the necessary dependencies and configuration.

## Project Structure

A typical Nuxt 3 project follows this structure:

```
my-app/
├── components/     # Vue components
├── composables/    # Composable functions
├── layouts/        # Layout components
├── pages/          # File-based routing
├── plugins/        # Vue plugins
├── public/         # Static assets
├── server/         # Server-side code
└── nuxt.config.ts  # Configuration file
```

## Key Features

### Auto-imports

One of the most loved features is auto-imports. You can use components, composables, and Vue functions without explicit imports:

```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <MyComponent />
  </div>
</template>

<script setup lang="ts">
const count = ref(0)
const route = useRoute()
</script>
```

### Data Fetching

Nuxt 3 provides powerful composables for data fetching:

```typescript
const { data, pending, error } = await useFetch('/api/posts')
```

### Layouts

Create reusable layouts for your pages:

```vue
<!-- layouts/default.vue -->
<template>
  <div>
    <Header />
    <slot />
    <Footer />
  </div>
</template>
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use Composables**: Extract reusable logic into composables
2. **Type Everything**: Leverage TypeScript for better DX
3. **Optimize Images**: Use the built-in image optimization
4. **Code Splitting**: Let Nuxt handle automatic code splitting
5. **SEO**: Use `useHead` for meta tags and SEO optimization

## Conclusion

Nuxt 3 is a powerful framework that makes building modern web applications a joy. With its excellent developer experience, performance optimizations, and extensive features, it's an excellent choice for your next Vue.js project.
